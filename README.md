# Project 2, Group 8
## Program Goals
TODO: More detailed explaination of our specific program goals (galaxy image classification)

On this project we will practice both our technical and collaborative skills. We will work in groups of 3 people. The project will be divided in 3 parts: Data Exploration, Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering, and Model Selection and Evaluation. We will collaborate with our group members to complete the project. We will also be responsible for our own individual submissions.

## Data Source
TODO: describe data in further detail, what is it, how is it cleaned/split?

The data source for our project comes from the following github repo:
